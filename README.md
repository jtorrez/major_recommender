## The Problem
<br>

Two important choices face first time college students: where will they go to college and what will they major in? An entire industry has been built around the first question: tutors are now paid over $50/hr (that’s 100k a year if you’re counting…) helping students get into and pick the “right” college for them. In addition, most students have the chance to work one-on-one with a college counselor at their high school to guide them through the process. However, there exists far fewer resources for guiding students to the field that will be the best fit for them. The saturation of resources on only one of those two problems in unfortunate due to the fact that it has become more apparent in recent years that where you go to college isn’t actually that important ([this book](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/frank-bruni/where-you-go-is-not-who-youll-be/9781455532704/) and [this book](http://www.billderesiewicz.com/books/excellent-sheep) have great discussions of the issue). 

**In order to address the question “what should I pick for my college major?”, I have built a college major recommendation system.**

It is first important to understand the audience for this system: those who really have no idea what they would like to do. Those who have wanted to be doctors, or lawyers, or astronauts since they were young won't find this tool to be of much use. But for those who enter school as undecided/exploratory majors or for those who would like to just explore some alternate ideas because they aren't completely sold on their major, this tool can offer a good starting place.

That is the other important component to understand about this system: it is only a starting place. It is also not meant to replace much more rigorous assessments and theories that have been thoroughly validated over decades (the [Strong Interest Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Interest_Inventory) and the work of [John Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes) are important places to start), but rather to provide a short, quick tool that is accessible to everyone and can point them in some new directions.

One of the difficulties in recommending a major for a student is how disparate, and sometimes even conflicting, the things you have to take into account for each individual student are. They may love art, but also want to be making 100k a year by the time they are 30. They may want to go pre-med, but also have a normal work life balance both in college and later in life. I believe that this is part of the reason that are so few resources out there for picking a major: there are just too many things to take into account. There may be an article addressing how to pick based on your passions, or one advising you about the incomes of different majors, or one that suggests that your Myers-Briggs type is what will really decide whether that field you are considering is a good fit for you, but they are rarely synthesized into one place. Even when they are (such as this [excellent site](http://www.bestcolleges.com/resources/choosing-a-major/)), they still require you to go through and parse an overwhelming amount of information. 

**The recommender system I built focused on two main areas (as a proof of concept): the passions/interests of students and their desired future income/career aspirations.**
